  "description": "Hi, my name is Pablo and I'm a web developer for almost 6 years. My first experience happened in a digital agency where I used to develop backend and frontend of local ecommerces using jQuery, HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL.\n After that, I joined a tool shop company that had a website and helped to redevelop all of the frontend (and some backend) for the online store using Zend Framework, jQuery, HTML and CSS.\n THe following job was the most challenging: be one of main developers of a smart city platform that combined: geospatial information, Internet Of Things, OpenData and Digital Business Process Management. Quite a great job using AngularJS, PHP and MySQL and some other satellite technologies such as MongoDB, Python, FiWare technologies, SAP Cloud Platform and so on.\n Leaving that company, I joined a project that aimed to rebuild the Westcon Comstor group intranet, that was when I first used VueJS + C# ASP NET MVC as a professional and loved it. \n The following job was at Krint, working to Loyalty Corp Australian fintech, building the front-end of a enterprise social network. \n Besides that, I usually take some freelances to work on mobile applications using Ionic. I think that's it. \n Hope you like it. I'm very excited about this opportunity."
